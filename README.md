## Requirements <a name="Requirements"></a>

* **General**
    * Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    * All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    * All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
    * All your files should end with a new line (why?)
    * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
    * A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
    * A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of *this* project, describing what each script is doing
    * You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
    * All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the `chmod` command: `chmod u+x FILENAME_GOES_HERE`.Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
